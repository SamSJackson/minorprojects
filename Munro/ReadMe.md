This program is very basic.
I recommend running in terminal.

I enjoy climbing mountains and figured it would be fun to vaguely find nearby Munros to me.

TO RUN:
1. Download the whole file
2. Run the "Munros.py" file (preferably in a terminal)

IMPORTANT TO NOTE:
  - The locations are only of major areas (primarily cities)
  - The distance is haversine distance:
      Haversine distance is just using two points together and drawing a straight line (around the globe, not through the globe). 
      Example: Haversine distance will draw the distance between Scotland and Australia with a direct line straight over the ocean.
      
      This basically just means that the haversine distance will be less than travelling distance, often substantially.
      

Everyone is more than welcome to:

- Make any requests
